        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>Currently, I am an art student at UCR that aspires to be a UI designer for apps. I have experience  mentoring underclassmen and was a reliable resource for student life assistance. In my high school, I served as the President of Technical Theater Club, Key Club Publicist, and UNICEF Board Member. During my time in these roles, I was able to polish my leadership experience by exposing myself to different communities. My problem solving and quick thinking were constantly tested and are therefore some of my strong qualities.<br><br>
        From June 2022 to September 2022, I worked as a 7 Leaves team member. As a team member, my responsibilities included creating fresh drinks customers, handling money at the register, and communicating with customers in need. During a high pressure setting, team members are expected to work together efficiently to make drinks in a timely manner. From this teamwork, we were able to make over 100 drinks in an hour. The location of my 7 Leaves was in a very diverse area. Therefore my ability to speak Mandarin, Chinese was incredibly beneficial when at the cash register. While being a Key Club Publicist. I spent my time designing posters,  flyers and making promotional media regarding the club. I have designed over 15 posters and have taken over 50 photos and videos to promote the club on our school websites and social media.<br><br>
        While transitioning to college, I found myself having trouble adjusting to a new lifestyle in a new city. However, the resources and people here at UCR allowed me to maintain discipline and engage with the surrounding community. During my first quarter, I spent most of my time attending community events in the resident halls such as tote-bag decorating and silent disco night to introduce myself to a new environment. As the academic year continued, I joined UCR’s design club to explore a possible career in User Experience design, and the Residents Hall Student Association (RHA) for the Pentland Hills residence halls. By joining these groups, I was able to find the value in having a community of people around me to spend my days with.
